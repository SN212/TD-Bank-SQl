Project Scope – Data Feed Processing & Validation Automation

Generate Sample Data Files

Feed-1: 10 columns × 10 rows.

Feed-2: 15 columns × 15 rows.

Feed-3: 20 columns × 20 rows.

Automate Data File Creation (SQL)

Develop SQL scripts to generate the data files from Requirement 1 dynamically.

Script should accept parameters: Feed Name and Number of Rows to be populated.

Identify Duplicate Records

Write SQL queries to detect duplicate rows within each feed table (Feed-1, Feed-2, Feed-3).

Export Duplicates

Save identified duplicate rows into an output file named "duplicates".

Remove Duplicates and Update Tables

Create a script to replace duplicate rows with unique records.

Update the corresponding Feed table with these unique rows.

Verification of Duplicate Removal

Execute the duplicate detection script again to ensure the output count is zero.

Data Comparison Across Feeds

Write SQL scripts to compare records from Feed-2 and Feed-3 against Feed-1.

Export comparison results into an output file.

Test Plan Creation

Develop a comprehensive manual test plan covering all possible scenarios to validate the entire end-to-end functionality.

Test Case Automation

Automate the test cases from Requirement 8 using any feasible automation method or framework.

Project Documentation

Prepare detailed documentation in MS Word, including:

Requirements and scope.

SQL scripts.

Automation process.

Test cases and results.

Screenshots for each stage.

Final output verification.
